A mongo db enabled environment with php and nginx

To start the project you need to have docker installed on your machine first

1. Start Docker 
2. Clone the project to your machine anywhere you like (ex: your desktop) `clone git@github.com:engmohammedyehia/mongodb.git`
3. Open your terminal and point to the project directory 
4. Start the docker containers `docker-compose up -d`

Note: you don't need to build as the docker-compose.yml contains only images
